The code appears to be a Markdown file, and it looks like it's a standard README file for a repository. Here's the corrected code:

    # README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for?

*   Quick summary
*   Version
*   [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### How do I get set up?

*   Summary of set up
*   Configuration
*   Dependencies
*   Database configuration
*   How to run tests
*   Deployment instructions

### Contribution guidelines

*   Writing tests
*   Code review
*   Other guidelines

### Who do I talk to?

*   Repo owner or admin
*   Other community or team contact

I fixed the following issues:

* Added asterisks () to indicate bullet points in the Markdown syntax.
* No spelling or grammar mistakes were found in the original code.
